To generate the project files you must download premake from:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/crayzedsgui/premake-3.7-custom.zip
and place the executable (premake.exe) in this directory.

First you should edit config.lua to make sure you get what you need.

After this is done you should run the .bat files corresponding to your version
of 'Microsoft Visual C++' (MSVC). This will generate a solution in this directory.

You can run clean.bat to clean up the project files in case you want to switch
to another version of MSVC.

Once you have compiled CEGUI and the samples successfully, you should copy the
dll's from 'cegui_mk2/bin' to 'cegui_mk2/Samples/bin' as the samples are placed
in this directory and needs to be able to find CEGUIBase.dll etc.
Alternatively you can add your 'cegui_mk2/bin' directory you your PATH
environment variable.

Also note that the dll's from the dependency directory should be placed in the
appropriate folder, as above.
