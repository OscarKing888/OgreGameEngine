--
-- Here you can set up any additional paths you require for the various projects
-- in CEGUI.  This is useful if, for example, you are using some SDK that has
-- additional external dependencies of it's own (for example, boost used with
-- Ogre).  All you need to do is add an entry in the following table to indicate
-- the base directory, include sub-directory, library-subdirectory, and optionally
-- the name of the CEGUI project to add the paths to (if no project is given, the
-- paths are added to /all/ projects).
--
-- NB: Each entry should be surrounded by curly braces, with each entry
-- separated with a comma and appearing within the existing braces.
--
-- For example, to add the OgreSDK boost paths to build for the Ogre renderer
-- module and sample helper with Ogre support, you might have:
